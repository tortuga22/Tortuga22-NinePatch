 This draws the NinePatch with its upper-left corner at a specified location in a specified context, scaled to fit content of the size.

 @param point The upper left corner the NinePatch will be drawn at.

 This draws the NinePatch centered (horizontally and vertically) inside the containmentRect in the specified context, sized to fit content of the passed-in size. This is essentially a convenience method wrapping inContext:drawAtPoint:forContentOfSize:. Like its cousin it'll probably be modified to return information about where the content should be drawn. Will let the NinePatch overflow the containmentRect if the necessary size is sufficiently large; it'll be centered, just too big.
